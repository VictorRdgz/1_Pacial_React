        <h1>10 Things Every Small-Business Website Needs</h1>

        <div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>A clear description of who you are</b></li>
                <p>
                Someone who stumbles upon your website shouldn't have to do investigative work to figure out what, 
                exactly. <br/>
                It is that you do. That means clearly stating your name and summing up your products or services 
                right on the homepage, says John Zhuang, of Web-design and SEO-optimization firm Winning Interactive.
                </p>
            <li><b>A simple, sensible Web address</b></li>
                <p>
                "Your domain name is like your brand. It should be easy for a user to type it into a Web browser or an e-mail 
                address," says Ron Wright. <br/> 
                The founder of business Web design and online marketing firm Accentix.
                </p>
            <li><b>Easy-to-find contact information</b></li>
                <p>
                You wouldn't want to lose a customer to a competitor just because you made it difficult for them to get in touch with 
                you. <br/>
                You should also be sure to include several ways for them to contact you -- phone, e-mail, and a standard contact form, 
                are all good options. <br/>
                Forbes also suggests including your address, and even a link to your location in Google maps.
                </p>
            <li><b>An easily-navigated site map</b></li>
                <p>
                Clear links to the most important pages, and a site map, are crucial for guiding visitors to 
                the information they're looking for.
                </p>
            <li><b>Customer testimonials</b></li>
                <p>
                Honest words from others help make your products or services more tangible to customers who are visiting you online.
                </p>
            <li><b>An obvious call to action</b></li>
                <p>
                "Tell the online visitors literally what you want them to do with clear tones of commend," says Zhuang. <br/>
                "For instance, you may want them to call you now for free quote, or sign up to your exclusively online coupons, 
                or add products to the online shopping cart, etc."
                </p>
            <li><b>Know the basics of SEO</b></li>
                <p>
                Your website won't do you as much good if no one can stumble upon it. <br/>
                Become familiar with the SEO basics to make it more accessible by search engine.
                </p>
            <li><b>Fresh, quality content</b></li>
                <p>
                For many businesses, your website is your first impression on a customer. <br/>
                You want to give them what they're looking for, and perhaps even give them a reason to keep coming back.
                </p>
            <li><b>A secure hosting platform</b></li>
                <p>
                Having your online information hijacked is a nightmare, and, should it happen to your business, it could cost you customers.
                </p>
            <li><b>A design and style that's friendly to online readers</b></li>
                <p>
                As Forbes puts it, "Web surfers have the attention spans of drunken gnats." <br/>

                Zhuang describes it in more detail: "Online visitors often scan through a Web page to sample the content 
                first when they open a new Web page. If they feel like they are on the right page, they will slow down to 
                read the full story. To enhance user's experience on your small business website, you need to organize the 
                content for scanning." <br/>

                He recommends three style points for online writing to keep in mind: <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Break things down into short paragraphs, with headers if necessary</li>
                    <li>Use bullet points</li>
                    <li>Highlight important words or phrases.</li>
                </ul>

                </p>
        </ol>
